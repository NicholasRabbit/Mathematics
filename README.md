# Mathematics
I had tried to learn mathematics in Chinese. Unfortunately, it is hard to find books or videos which are friendly to beginners or self-learners.
The purpose of these educational experts and teachers is to show that they know but not to let you know. As a consequence, all the books 
are full of symbols and proofs which is quite difficult to understand. This situation changed after I read an article about how to learn mathematics effectively. 
The author recommends readers learn math in English because almost all of the masterpieces on math were written in English and 
the most important is that they are quite friendly to beginners. There is another reason is the inaccuracy of Chinese translation. 
Of course,the interpreters should not be blamed because they need both professional mathematical knowledge and English to do the job.
