# Mathematics
I had tried to learn mathematics in Chinese which is my mother tongue. Unfortunately, it is hard to find books or videos which are friendly to beginners or self-learners. The purpose of these educational experts and teachers are doing is to show that they know but not to let you know. As a consequence, all the books are full of symbols and proofs which is quite difficult to understand. Admittedly, that undermines my confidence and enthusiasm to learn math. 

This situation has changed after I read an essay about how to learn mathematics effectively. The author recommends readers learn math in English because almost all of the masterpieces on math are written in English and the most important thing is that they are quite friendly to beginners. The another reason is the inaccuracy of Chinese translation. Of course, the interpreters should not be to blame because to do the job well needs both professional mathematical knowledge and English but seldom do they have.
